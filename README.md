# README for modi-SIC Assembler Project

This project is a simulation of a **Modified Simple Instruction Computer (modi-SIC)** assembler. The program reads an assembly file written in modi-SIC assembly language, processes it through two passes, and generates the necessary output files, including the **HTE record**, **symbol table**, and **object code**.

## Introduction

The **modi-SIC** is an extension of the **Simple Instruction Computer (SIC)** architecture. It includes:
- **Format 1** instructions.
- **Immediate instructions** (Format 3) that allow direct value handling.
- Memory reservation using `BYTE`, `WORD`, `RESB`, and `RESW`.

The assembler reads an input file (`in.txt`), processes it through two passes, and generates intermediate files, symbol tables, and object code in HTE format.

---

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

1. **HelloApplication.java**: The main Java class that initializes the GUI and handles the assembly process.
2. **Input File (`in.txt`)**: The assembly program written in modi-SIC assembly language.
3. **Intermediate File (`intermediate.txt`)**: The assembly program after removing comments and line numbers.
4. **Pass 1 Output (`out_pass1.txt`)**: Contains the location counter for each instruction.
5. **Symbol Table (`symbTable.txt`)**: Contains the symbol table generated during Pass 1.
6. **Pass 2 Output (`out_pass2.txt`)**: Contains the object code for each instruction.
7. **HTE Record (`HTE.txt`)**: Contains the object code in HTE format.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
   - The input file (`in.txt`) should be placed in the project directory.

2. **Running the Program**:
   - Compile the Java code:
     ```bash
     javac HelloApplication.java
     ```
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     java HelloApplication
     ```
   - The program will generate the following files:
     - `intermediate.txt`
     - `out_pass1.txt`
     - `symbTable.txt`
     - `out_pass2.txt`
     - `HTE.txt`

## Input File Format

The input file (`in.txt`) should contain assembly code written in modi-SIC assembly language. Example:

```assembly
COPY START 1000
FIRST STL RETADR
CLOOP JSUB RDREC
LDA LENGTH
COMP ZERO
JEQ ENDFIL
JSUB WRREC
J CLOOP
ENDFIL LDA EOF
STA BUFFER
LDA THREE
STA LENGTH
JSUB WRREC
LDL RETADR
RSUB
EOF BYTE C'EOF'
THREE WORD 3
ZERO WORD 0
RETADR RESW 1
LENGTH RESW 1
BUFFER RESB 4096

## Output File
1. Intermediate File (intermediate.txt)
The intermediate file is generated by removing comments and line numbers from the input file. Example:
COPY START 1000
FIRST STL RETADR
CLOOP JSUB RDREC
...

2. Pass 1 Output (out_pass1.txt)
This file contains the location counter for each instruction. Example:
1000 COPY START
1003 FIRST STL
1006 CLOOP JSUB
...

3. Symbol Table (symbTable.txt)
The symbol table contains all labels and their corresponding addresses. Example:
COPY     1000
CLOOP    1003
ENDFIL   1015
...

4. Pass 2 Output (out_pass2.txt)
This file contains the object code for each instruction. Example:
1000 00
1003 4C
1006 48
...

5. HTE Record (HTE.txt)
The HTE record contains the object code in HTE format. Example:
H^COPY^001000^00001A
T^001000^0A^...
M^001000^06
E^001000

##Implementation Details
Pass 1
Reads the intermediate file (intermediate.txt).

Generates the location counter for each instruction.

Builds the symbol table by resolving labels and their addresses.

Pass 2
Reads the intermediate file again.

Generates the object code for each instruction.

Resolves immediate instructions and memory reservations.

Produces the HTE record in the required format.

Immediate Instructions
Immediate instructions are handled by setting the immediate flag (i) in the opcode.

Example: LDA #3 (load the immediate value 3 into register A).

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic framework for a modi-SIC assembler. It can be extended and enhanced to include more features and functionality as needed. The program is designed to be modular, making it easy to add new features or modify existing ones.
